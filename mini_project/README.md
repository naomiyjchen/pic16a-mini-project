# pic16a-mini-project
This is a collaborative work with Yuriko Sanno and Zhiyuan Ren from class PIC16A at UCLA taught by prof. Phil Chodrow.
The project has the standard workflow of a data science project. 
We used the data from https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv to predict the penguin species.
The model we used are: 
  - decision trees 
  - support vector machine (SVM)
  - multinomial linear regression (MLR)
